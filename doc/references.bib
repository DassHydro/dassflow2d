  abstract = {{Numerous codes are being developed to solve Shallow Water equations.
	Because there are used in hydraulic and environmental studies, their
	capability to simulate properly flow dynamics is critical to guarantee
	infrastructure and human safety. While validating these codes is
	an important issue, code validations are currently restricted because
	analytic solutions to the Shallow Water equations are rare and have
	been published on an individual basis over a period of more than
	five decades. This article aims at making analytic solutions to the
	Shallow Water equations easily available to code developers and users.
	It compiles a significant number of analytic solutions to the Shallow
	Water equations that are currently scattered through the literature
	of various scientific disciplines. The analytic solutions are described
	in a unified formalism to make a consistent set of test cases. These
	analytic solutions encompass a wide variety of flow conditions (supercritical,
	subcritical, shock, etc.), in 1 or 2 space dimensions, with or without
	rain and soil friction, for transitory flow or steady state. The
	corresponding source codes are made available to the community (http://www.univ-orleans.fr/mapmo/soft/SWASHES),
	so that users of Shallow Water-based models can easily find an adaptable
	benchmark library to validate their numerical methods.}},

  abstract = {{This paper presents a new functionality of the Automatic Differentiation
	(AD) tool Tapenade. Tapenade generates adjoint codes which are widely
	used for optimization or inverse problems. Unfortunately, for large
	applications the adjoint code demands a great deal of memory, because
	it needs to store a large set of intermediates values. To cope with
	that problem, Tapenade implements a sub-optimal version of a technique
	called checkpointing, which is a trade-off between storage and recomputation.
	Our long-term goal is to provide an optimal checkpointing strategy
	for every code, not yet achieved by any AD tool. Towards that goal,
	we first introduce modifications in Tapenade in order to give the
	user the choice to select the checkpointing strategy most suitable
	for their code. Second, we conduct experiments in real-size scientific
	codes in order to gather hints that help us to deduce an optimal
	checkpointing strategy. Some of the experimental results show memory
	savings up to 35\% and execution time up to 90\%.}},

	especially designed for variational data assimilation. The forward
	model is based on the bidimensional shallow-water equations, solved
	by a finite volume method (HLLC approximate Riemann solver). It is
	written in Fortran 95. The adjoint code is generated by the automatic
	differentiation tool Tapenade. Thus, Dassflow software includes the

	(based on the M1QN3 minimization routine) and benchmarks. The generation
	of new data assimilation twin experiments is easy. The software is
	interfaced with few pre and post-processors (mesh generators, GIS
	tools and visualization tools), which allows to treat real data.}},

abstract = {Discretisation of the friction terms to ensure numerical stability and accuracy remains to be challenging for the development of robust numerical schemes to solve the shallow water equations (SWEs), particularly for applications involving very shallow flows (e.g. overland flows and wet/dry fronts) over complex domain topography. The key challenge is to ensure relaxation of the flow towards an equilibrium state characterised by the balance between friction and gravity in a computationally efficient way. To overcome this numerical challenge, this paper proposes a novel approach for discretising the friction source terms in the SWEs in the context of an explicit finite volume method. The overall numerical scheme adopts the HLLC Riemann solver and surface reconstruction method (SRM) to explicitly discretise the flux and bed slope source terms. Whilst a fully implicit scheme is used to handle the friction source terms, solution to the implicit formulation is analytically derived to explicitly update the flow variables. Compared with the existing approaches, the proposed scheme effectively resolves the issue associated with stiff relaxation without necessity to use an iteration method and it supports efficient simulation using time steps controlled only by the Courant–Friedrichs–Levy (CFL) condition. The current friction term discretisation scheme is not coupled with flux and bed slope calculation and therefore may be readily implemented in any other explicit finite volume SWE models. After being successfully validated against two benchmark tests with analytical solutions, the resulting new SWE model is applied to reproduce a rainfall-flooding event in the Upper Lee catchment in the UK.}
