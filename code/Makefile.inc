#  This file is part of the DassFlow software (Data Assimilation for Free Surface Flows).
#  DassFlow is a computational software whose purpose is to simulate geophysical free surface flows,
#  designed for variational sensitivities and data assimilation (4D-var). Inverse capabilities are
#  based on the adjoint code generation by a source-to-source algorithmic differentiation (Tapenade software used).
#
#  DassFlow software includes few mostly independent "modules" with common architectures and structures.
#  Please consult the DassFlow webpage for more details: http://www-gmm.insa-toulouse.fr/~monnier/DassFlow/.
#
#  Many people have contributed to the DassFlow development from the initial version to the latest ones.
#  Current contributions:
#               L. Pujol (PhD Unistra)
#               L. Villenave (PhD student)
#               P.-A. Garambois (INRAE Aix-en-Provence)

#   Reminder of makefile commands
#======================================================================================================================#

# Open console in the directory of this file
# To call make, type "make +commands". Any number of the following commands can be added. They will be executed in order.
# Example : "make clean cleanres cleanmin runexe"

#clean               : removes the exe file in the bin directory
#cleanres, cleanplot : deletes all in the /res and /plot folder in the bin directory
#cleanmin            : deletes all in the /min folder in the bin directory + deletes restart.bin
#cleantap            : deletes all in the /tap folder
#tap_files           : generates files for the /tap folder
#lib                 : generates libraries (depends on user parameters, see below)

#rundirect  : performs a direct mode run
#runmin     : performs an inverse mode run
#runtestadj : performs a test of the adjoint model
#rungrad    : computes the cost gradient
